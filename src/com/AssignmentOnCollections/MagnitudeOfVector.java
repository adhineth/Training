/*
Q. Write a method in the vector that calculates and returns the magnitude(length) of a vector
The magnitude of a vector is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of squares of its elements

Agenda is to know the length of the vector
1. what is the data type of vector? int : write a method with int data type that calculate...
2. what is the input? Assuming 2D vector (plane coordinates) 2 inputs (x,y)
3. what should be the logic?
